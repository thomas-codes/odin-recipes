<h3>Description</h3>
<strong> Lamb Chops have a flavorful garlic and herb crust with a juicy and tender center. These holiday-worthy lamb chops are simple and excellent and wait until you try the easy 2-ingredient pan sauce!</strong>
<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<ul>

 <li>Lamb rib chops</uli>
 <li>Garlic cloves</li>
 <li>Parsley</li>
 <li>Tabsco sauce</li>
 <li>Seasonings</li>
 <li>Chicken Stock</li>
 <li>Butter</li>


</ul>
<h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Thoroughly pat lamb chops dry with paper towels, wiping away any possible bone fragments or shards. Slice between ribs to separate chops, cutting them into even portions (3/4″ to 1″ thick.</li>
<li> In a measuring cup, stir together garlic, olive oil, parsley, Tabasco, salt, pepper and thyme</li>
<li>Place chops in a non-reactive casserole dish and pour marinade over the chops. Rub the marinade all over the chops, then cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
<li> Remove chops from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Heat a large heavy pan over high heat. Add 1 Tbsp oil to the hot pan. Add chops and sear for 2-4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the chops and desired doneness (see chart below). Sautee in 2 batches if needed.</li>
<li>Transfer to a platter, tent with foil and rest the lamb chops for 5 minutes while making the pan sauce</li>
<li> Leave 1 to 2 Tbsp oil in the pan, being careful not to remove the drippings and flavorings. Add 1/2 cup stock and simmer 2 min. Turn off the heat then swirl in butter. Spoon sauce over lamb chops and garnish with chopped parsley if desired.
</li>
</ol>
